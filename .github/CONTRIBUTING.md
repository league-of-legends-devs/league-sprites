those that are disrespectful.

improvements, architecture, theory, internal implementation, etc. Please, join or start a new
conversation in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/league-of-legends-devs/league-sprites/issues).

### Documentation

We need your help with improving documentation to the project. This might be the easiest way for

### Pull Requests

Before you submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) from your
forked repo, check that it meets these guidelines:

* If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated as part of the same PR.
* Create a separate PR for each small feature or bug fix.
* [Squash](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5189560/squash-my-last-x-commits-together-using-git)
  your commits into one for each PR.
* When contributing to an opt-in feature, apply the `[feature/...]` tag as a prefix to your PR title

#### Style Guide

Our linter will catch most styling issues that may exist in your code. You can check the status
of your code styling by simply running: `yarn lint`.

However, there are still some styles that the linter cannot pick up. If you are unsure about
something, looking at [Airbnb's Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) will guide you
in the right direction.
